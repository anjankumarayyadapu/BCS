Fannie Mae is one of the largest government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the
U.S. housing market, which was struggling with managing massive datasets
related to mortgages and loans. These datasets were stored on legacy onpremises
systems that were expensive to maintain and unable to scale effectively
to meet growing data demands. The companies recognized the need for cloud
migration to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enable better data-driven

decision-making. However, these legacy systems had complex integrations and
strict regulatory compliance requirements, making the migration a significant
challenge.
Task
I was tasked with leading the cloud migration initiative, ensuring a smooth
transition from on-premises data storage to the cloud while maintaining
compliance with industry regulations (strict data privacy and security protocols).
My goal was to enhance data accessibility, improve scalability, and facilitate better
data analytics capabilities in the cloud, ultimately empowering data-driven
decisions for loan approvals, risk management, and other financial operations.
Action
Data Assessment and Cloud Selection:
• I led a thorough assessment of the existing data systems, identifying the
critical datasets and understanding their dependencies.
• I collaborated with stakeholders to determine the best cloud provider and
architecture (choosing AWS for its flexibility, scalability, and compliance
capabilities).
Cloud Migration Strategy:
• I developed a phased migration plan that included the prioritization of highvalue
datasets for migration and developed a framework for data
governance.
• I ensured that all sensitive data was encrypted and maintained compliance
with regulatory standards.
Integration and Automation:
• I worked closely with data engineers to develop automated data pipelines
for migrating legacy data to the cloud, leveraging cloud-native tools.
• I implemented data transformation and cleansing processes to ensure data
quality during the migration.
Testing and Validation:
• I conducted rigorous testing of the cloud infrastructure to ensure
performance, scalability, and reliability under real-world conditions.

• I validated the integrity and accuracy of migrated data through multiple
rounds of testing.
Result
The migration to the cloud was completed successfully within the projected
timeline and budget.
As a success result:
• The cloud infrastructure enabled significant cost reductions (estimated at
30%) by eliminating the need for maintaining legacy systems and reducing
on-premises data storage.
• Data access and processing speeds improved drastically, enabling faster
decision-making and better risk management.
• The cloud platform facilitated advanced analytics, allowing Fannie Mae to
better assess loan performance, predict defaults, and optimize the
mortgage approval process.
• Compliance and security standards were met, with data encrypted at rest
and in transit, ensuring that industry regulations were adhered to without
compromising performance.
My efforts were recognized at a senior level for being exceptional, and I was
awarded a spot bonus in acknowledgment of this achievement.
